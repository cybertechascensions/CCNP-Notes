 - Configuring and verifying common Spanning Tree Protocols (RSTP and MST)
 - Comparing routing concepts of EIGRP and OSPF
 - Configuring and verifying simple OSPF environments, including multiple normal areas, summarization, and filtering (neighbor adjacency, point-to-point and broadcast network types, and passive interface)
 - Configuring and verifying eBGP between directly connected neighbors (best path selection algorithm and neighbor relationships)
 - Layer 1 concepts of wireless such as RF power, RSSI, SNR, interference noise, band and channels, and wireless client devices capabilities
 - AP modes and antenna types
 - Main principles and use cases for Layer 2 and Layer 3 roaming
 - Troubleshooting WLAN configuration and wireless client connectivity issues
 - Network Time Protocol (NTP)
 - Configuring and verifying NAT/PAT
